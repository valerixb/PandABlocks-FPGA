[ENABLE]
type: bit_mux
description: Enable when high, keep in reset when low

[KP]
type: param scalar
description: Proportional Gain
extension: kP
scale: 1.52587890625e-5

[KI]
type: param scalar
description: Integral Gain (parallel form)
extension: kI
scale: 1.52587890625e-5

[KD]
type: param scalar
description: Derivative Gain (parallel form)
extension: kD
scale: 1.52587890625e-5

[F_FILTER]
type: param scalar
description: Derivative filter cutoff frequency (Hz)
extension: f_filter
scale: 1
units: Hz

[CMD]
type: pos_mux
description: Command (desired value)

[MEAS]
type: pos_mux
description: Actual measured value

[OUT]
type: pos_out
description: Control to plant
scale: 4.656612873e-10
units: FS1

[THRESH]
type: param scalar
description: Input threshold (full scale=1) no action is taken if the input error (=CMD-MEAS) is below this threshold: it's a deadband. This value can be 0.
scale: 9.313225746e-10
units: FS1

[MAX_OUT]
type: param scalar
description: Output saturation limit (full scale=1)
scale: 9.313225746e-10
units: FS1

[ANTI_INT_WNDP_RAT_G]
type: param scalar
description: Back calculation rational gain for anti integral windup. It is the ratio of kB (back calculation gain) and kI (integral gain). Usually, it should be =1; putting it to 0 disables the anti-integral windup.
scale: 9.313225746e-10
units: FS1

[INV_CMD]
type: param bit
description: Invert commanded value sign

[INV_MEAS]
type: param bit
description: Invert measured value sign

[DERIV_ON_PROCVAR]
type: param bit
description: Derivative on process variable instead of on input error(=CMD-MEAS). Usually you want it to be 1.
